									<p>Occasionally referred to as the “jewel in India’s crown,” Mumbai pulses and thumps with more than 18 million people. It’s the most populated city in the country and quickly growing. Given all those people and things to do, it’s easy to be distracted during your vacation in Mumbai.

Today, this city is a hearty stew of religions, customs, cuisine and bustling business. Local lore says there are more millionaires per kilometre in Mumbai than in Manhattan. One of this city’s biggest moneymakers is Bollywood, so don’t be surprised if you stumble across a film shoot with hundreds of beautiful dancers in flowing saris.</p>
									<p>No journey can be graced without exploring Gateway of India. Bordered by the great Arabian Sea and shadowed by the Taj Hotel, Gateway of India is one of the most valued & emblematic in the country. An imposing edifice, the Gateway of India is a symbol of India's rich history and cultural heritage. The view from the sea of the Gateway complex, especially at night, is as beautiful as that of the Queen's Necklace from the Marine Drive.
									<br><br>Experience true grandeur at The Taj Mahal Palace, the iconic sea-facing landmark in Colaba, south Mumbai. This flagship Taj hotel offers you splendid views of the Arabian Sea and Gateway of India, alongside refined century-old hospitality.
								<br><br>Marine drive is a must visit if you are in Mumbai. You should try and visit it in the evening when the lights are on and that is when you get to experience the 'Queen's Necklace ' form due to the lights. It's also a sight if you are landing in Mumbai in an aircraft. There are many highrise hotels and cafes on Marine Drive, you go visit those and experience the lovely view or take a drive.
							<br><br>Bandra Worli Sea Link is one of the few bridges that is a cable-stayed with pre-stressed concrete-steel viaducts to hold it in place. Spanning across the arc of Mumbai's coastline, this sea link is a civil engineering wonder that reflects the modern infrastructure of the city of Mumbai. The bridge is designed to cater around 37,500 vehicles per day while reducing the time travel between Bandra and Worli by a big margin.

<br><br>If you love thrills and adventure, a visit to Sanjay Gandhi National Park is a must. Spread over 87 sq km, this is the closest national park to Mumbai city, established in 1996. Featuring luxuriant forest land, lake, and wildlife; Sanjay Gandhi National Park has gained tremendous popularity amongst adventure lovers and has secured a place in the league of best places to visit in Mumbai with friends. Enjoy forest hikes, trekking, boating, tiger and lion safari and hike to Kanheri caves located within the national park.</p>
									<p>Mumbai is a great city – the city of dreams. The vintage monuments, temples, museums and beaches enrich the list of places to visit in Mumbai and help one to decide which one to see first. If you are planning a Mumbai trip with Take a Trip, make sure to customise an enthralling itinerary and visit a maximum number of places for fun and frolic.</p>
