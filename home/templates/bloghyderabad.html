									<p> Hyderabad city is the capital of Telangana State and temporary capital of Andhra Pradesh. A city located on the bank of Musi River. It was established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. In 1724, Mughal King Asif Jah I declared his dominion and created his own empire, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. Hyderabad means "Haydar's city" from haydar (lion) and abad (city).
               One more story says that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of the city, named it "Bhagyanagar" after Bhagmati, a local dancing girl with whom he had fallen in love. She converted to Islam and adopted the title, Hyder Mahal. The city was renamed Hyderabad in her honor.
              Hyderabad is very well connected to Indian cities by airlines, rail network, and Roads. New International airport “Rajiv Gandhi International Airport” is located around 20km from the city.</p>
									<p>Hyderabad was so much more than the conservative society rallying the streets of this heritage city.

Hyderabad was established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 at the banks of the Musi River to overcome the water shortages at Golconda fort. Later Hyderabad became the major trade center for pearls and diamonds as the mines of Golconda were rich with both. The lineage of the ten Qutb Shahi rulers then shifted their capital to Hyderabad, but the city was won by the Mughals to be eventually lost to the British.

The present-day Hyderabad can be divided into the historic city that is on the southern side of the Musi River, and the New City that sits on the northern banks.

Though most of the historical places in Hyderabad are in the old city, this division is hardly visible.

<br><br>Now Hyderabad bustles like an era from the past that is equipped with modern cars and tall glass skyscrapers. While on one side you will see bright Charminar standing tall reminding us of Hyderabad’s Nizami heritage, on the other side you will see cabs full of white-collared migrants rushing to Hitec city. Laad Bazaar is as popular as Mega Shopping Mall. While Golconda fort is a weekend’s delight for many, the GVK Inox isn’t much behind. KFC might have a long queue of burger-hungry customers, but Shah Ghouse Cafe is even busier.

Hyderabad is an interesting blend of traditional and modern that invites you to immerse in it even if that means elbowing your way through crowded streets or standing in line to get into the Golconda fort. These are just the battles you have to win in Hyderabad.

But if we are talking about imperfection, let me tell you that men stalked me even in the artistic lanes of Paris and Delhi, and I wouldn’t even get started on how crowded London tube gets.
<br><br>Visiting the Chowmallah palace could be a clichéd thing to do in Hyderabad, but we wanted to see the grandeur and the lifestyle of the Nizams, who lived in the Chowmallah palace during their ruling years from the 1700s until the partition and also hosted their royal guests in the palace. Now the mansion is a public museum which the eighth Nizam inaugurated in 2005.

Chowmallah palace which means four palaces as per the Urdu translation had various palaces for different uses. Some of the four mahals were for dance and entertainment, while some were to offer the best views of Hyderabad to the royal guests. Large fountains and lawns surrounded the mahals from all sides. Pigeons freely bathed and splashed around in the water fountains in the gardens, while a few cats drooled over the pigeons.

The exotic cars used by the Nizams are now on display in the palace, and you can also see the glass chandeliers, weapons, porcelain, jewelry, and many more royal artifacts in the museum.
<br><br>Charminar — which means four towers — stands tall on four ornate towers in each corner. Climb up one of these minarets to see the Lad bazaar and the web of streets that constitutes the old city of Hyderabad originating from the Charminar.

The Lad Bazaar gets its name from Laad which means Lacquer, and many bangles sold in the market are made out of it amongst the hundred other varieties.

In the Lad Bazaar, you would find yourself surrounded by embroidered clothes, colorful zari dupattas, gold, silver, and artificial jewelry, pearls, hand-stitched footwear, paintings, colorful umbrellas, and stalls of Nizami food, sugarcane juice, fruits, chaats, shawarmas, and much more.

The market is lit at night, and swarms of people head to the market for an evening meal or to purchase a pair of dazzling earrings to match their white salwar-kameez or to drink a glass of fresh sugar cane juice or to gorge on some kulfi while walking around the imposing Charminar. To each its own.

If you visit this bustling part of the town, make sure to get a cup of the Irani chai from the cafe behind the Charminar and sip it while watching the old and the new Hyderabad tune into a rhythm together.
<br><br>It doesn’t matter how many forts you have seen, each Indian fort still offers something unique. The fascinating part of the Golconda Fort is the three layers of walls that are each 17-35 feet thick. Even Aurangzeb wasn’t able to penetrate these walls, and thus Golconda is also known as the impregnable fort.

Not many people know that the famous and disputed diamond Kohinoor was mined from one of the mines of the Golconda region of Hyderabad. The diamonds excavated from the mines of Golconda proved lucky for the Qutub Shahis, who ruled Hyderabad up to 1687, and the Nizams, who ruled the city until the independence, when the Indian constitution integrated the princely state of Hyderabad with India.

We went to the fort at 9 am to avoid the heat, but the Nawabi sun glowed us on so hard that we were sweating in no time. To my surprise, though the venue promises to be plastic-free, vendors freely sold small plastic bags of water to quench the thirst of the tired visitors.

Though one of the fort’s building was closed for renovation, we climbed up a temple, and then to the canons kept at the top of the fort. One can see the shining city, the Qutub tombs, the Charminar, and the sinewy walls of the forts from up there.</p>
