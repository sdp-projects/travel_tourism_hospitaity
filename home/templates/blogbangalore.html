									<p>When you first think of Bangalore, the image that pops into your head will usually be a city full of pubs, cafes and of course, a traffic jam that you’ll get stuck in. I went there with this pre-conceived notion, but a visit there showed me a different side of the city. As a traveler, there are a lot of other things to do in Bangalore and interesting places to visit.

 <br><br>Built by an 18th-century king, Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace will give you a glimpse of the royal lifestyle of the kings. Right from the entrance, I could feel the palace’s regal vibe with two lush green gardens at the sides as I walked to the main palace.

Inside, I was lost in the maze of pillars, balconies, and rooms. I was amazed by the architectural marvel — several arches at the backside of the palace are designed such that they reflect sunlight, lighting up the entire gallery with a golden tint. The rest of my time there was spent in awe over the beautiful paintings and artefacts from the king’s collection.
<br><br>Lal Bagh Botanical garden is enormous! It took me almost 3 hours to finish walking around the periphery. I didn’t mind it though as it gave me the much-needed respite from the city noise.

First, I visited the Glass House inside the garden which was inspired by the Crystal Palace in London. When I went there, it was empty, and only the symmetry of the pillars became the subject of my photographs. However, if you visit it on the ‘Indian Independence Day’ or the ‘Republic Day,’ you will see an exotic flower show exhibition that houses more than 300 species of flowers.

I then proceeded to Peninsular Gneiss, which is a rock formation that is nearly 3 billion years old and is one of the oldest rocks on the planet! There is an old watch tower where you could get a beautiful view of the garden and city; the tower was built to mark the limits of the old Bangalore city.

There is also a huge lake in the compound, where I had the pleasure of watching some birds taking a dip in the water to beat the heat. But I was disheartened to see people fishing from this lake although it isn’t permitted.
<br><br>A visit to the Bangalore Palace will take you back in time when ‘grandeur’ was the norm. Just like Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, this one is bound to stun you with its opulence. The palace is full of vintage paintings, elegant furniture, and sophisticated chandeliers. But what struck me the most were the eerie faces of dead animals on the walls staring right at me.

There were also tables and chairs made from elephant legs and trunks — a cruel reminder of animal hunting, both now and in the past. The whole tour was made more informative because of the audio guide, which was provided at the entrance and it helped me to take my own sweet time to move around the huge palace.

Though the entry fee might be rather expensive (Rs.225 for Indians and Rs.450 for foreigners), I found the visit was worth the cost.</p>
									<p>Count your lucky stars if you are planning a one day trip near Bangalore. With a plethora of options, you can choose from historic sites, ancient temples, hill stations, jungles, old towns, and scenic countryside.</p>
