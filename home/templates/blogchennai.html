									<p>Chennai is known for its beautiful culture and lively festivals. If you are looking forward to visiting Chennai in December, you’re in for a treat! Since it is situated off the coastline, Chennai experiences a tropical climate from October to December. Right from adventurous activities to pleasant sightseeing spots, there is a lot you can do here. The spectacular monuments, breathtaking beaches, scenic waterfalls, top-notch resorts, and beautiful temples are some of the major highlights of Chennai. Everything from the delicious South Indian dishes, to Carnatic music, will add to your experience.</p>
									<p>Chennai is not only the 4th largest city in India, but it is also called the cultural capital of India. The city is a perfect blend of art, architecture, dance, music, and drama. The city is also famous for its temples, museums, churches, white-sand beaches, and most importantly mouth-watering seafood. Here is a list of the top three places to visit in Chennai in December.
									<br><br>This mesmerizing beach owns the credit of being India’s longest and world’s second-largest beach. Marina Beach is one of the most visited places in Chennai during the month of December when the temperature is pleasant and inviting falling between 20 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius.

The beach is always refreshing and peaceful making it perfect for strolling and walking in the evening with your loved ones. Apart from that, we strongly recommend you click photos of the splendid sunset views and savor some lip-smacking local delicacies at the restaurants close to the beach.
<br><br>The 7th-century Adi Dravidian temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, in the form of Kapaleeswar and his consort Parvati named Karpagambal here. The surrounding area, Mylapore is a riot of colours with its charming markets selling everything from fruits and vegetables to souvenirs and artefacts. If you’re here before the 9-day long Navratri Festival, be prepared to spend at least a couple of hours exploring the resplendent streets where colourful dolls and idols are sold. After the chaos in Mylapore Market, visit the Ramakrishna Universal Temple dedicated to world prosperity. This modern temple combines traditional Dravidian architecture with Jain and Buddhist style. It has been built not for any specific religion, but to urge worshippers to find faith through the discovery of their inner selves.
<br><br>The Birla Planetarium at Kotturpuram, between Adyar and Guindy, is the most modern planetarium in the country. Adjoining the planetarium is a Periyar Science and Technology Museum which will be of interest to students and other science scholars.
<br><br>Fort St. George occupies a place of pride and prominence in Chennai. It was built in 1640 AD, by the British East India Company under the direct supervision of Francis Day and Andrew Cogon. This bastion achieved its name from St. George, the patron saint of England.</p>
									<p>On the Coromandel Coast overlooking the Bay of Bengal is Chennai, the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. It is also the most prominent cultural, educational, and economic center of southern India. As such, there is an endless list of incredible things to see and do in Chennai. The city, which is the sixth-most populous in India, is one of the most visited in the country by foreign tourists. It is also considered the safest city in India and welcomes a large number of health tourists as “India’s health capital.”</p>
